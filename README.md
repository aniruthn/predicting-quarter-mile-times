# Predicting Quarter Mile Times Using Machine Learning

Read the paper here: https://github.com/aniruthn/predicting-quarter-mile-times/blob/main/Predicting%20Quarter%20Mile%20Times%20Using%20Machine%20Learning.pdf

The individual files are how I scraped, trained, and tested the data. The actual dataset is not displayed here; the scraper does take many hours to run due to the large number of web pages it processes.

If you would like the paper without the watermark, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I have more projects on my GitHub and on my website https://aniruthn.com/
